# Key Mix-up

I have removed this from the main read me because it seems like it has been
fixed!

This is the driver for apple HID devices:

https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blame/master/drivers/hid/hid-apple.c

This is the "quirk" that fixes the problem I have found:

```
static const struct apple_key_translation apple_iso_keyboard[] = {
	{ KEY_GRAVE,	KEY_102ND },
	{ KEY_102ND,	KEY_GRAVE },
	{ }
};
```

It seems from the blame information that they have known about this for a long
time.

There was a clean-up because I guess it wasn't choosing the quirks properly
when there were multiple:
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/5476fcf7f7b901db1cea92acb1abdd12609e30e1

Except if you check the tags of that commit, it is in kernel version 6.2

and I have

```
$ uname -r
6.2.0-31-generic
```

here is some info about the device:

```
$ lsusb
...
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 05ac:0237 Apple, Inc. Internal Keyboard/Trackpad (ISO)
...
```

and here is some info about what drivers it is using:
(for future reference)

```
$ lsusb -t
...
/:  Bus 01.Port 1: Dev 1, Class=root_hub, Driver=ohci-pci/7p, 12M
    |__ Port 5: Dev 2, If 0, Class=Human Interface Device, Driver=usbhid, 1.5M
    |__ Port 6: Dev 3, If 2, Class=Human Interface Device, Driver=bcm5974, 12M
    |__ Port 6: Dev 3, If 0, Class=Human Interface Device, Driver=usbhid, 12M
    |__ Port 6: Dev 3, If 1, Class=Human Interface Device, Driver=usbhid, 12M
```

If you search the linux repo for the two codes in the `lsusb` output, you find
them in
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/3669558bdf354cd352be955ef2764cde6a9bf5ec/drivers/input/mouse/bcm5974.c

```
#define USB_VENDOR_ID_APPLE		0x05ac
```

```
#define USB_DEVICE_ID_APPLE_WELLSPRING3_ISO	0x0237
```

This is a combined mouse (trackpad) and keyboard so I guess that's why it is
in the mouse directory.

but looking down the search results, the same info is in here:
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/3669558bdf354cd352be955ef2764cde6a9bf5ec/drivers/hid/hid-ids.h

So back to `hid-apple.c`

https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/c3388ddc74a863466c7c3fa24d3a9cea9c9bca53

```
  { HID_USB_DEVICE(USB_VENDOR_ID_APPLE, USB_DEVICE_ID_APPLE_WELLSPRING2_ISO),
- 		.driver_data = APPLE_HAS_FN },
+ 		.driver_data = APPLE_HAS_FN | APPLE_ISO_TILDE_QUIRK },
```


Six months ago somebody added the `APPLE_ISO_TILDE_QUIRK` to the
`USB_DEVICE_ID_APPLE_WELLSPRING2_ISO` - so I think this is gonna fix it.

And if you look at the commit message, they checked a lot of keyboards!

And looking at the tags for this commit, it should be out in kernel version
6.4. So let's check the ubuntu schedule.

https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle#ubuntu-kernel-release-cycle
doesn't say anything.  Things go up to 6.2.  However, according to some guy
on the internet
https://askubuntu.com/questions/517136/list-of-ubuntu-versions-with-corresponding-linux-kernel-version
23.10 is going to have kernel 6.5, and I think that means that they will send
out the same version to all the LTS customers. We'll see.  If not maybe I'll
switch to non LTS. So this problem will probably be fixed by the time you read
this, and if not, you might just be able to wait.

### Keys 49 and 94 Are Mixed Up!

NOTE: this is my original workaround. I think this can be done more simply if
needed in future. However, I am mainly leaving it here so that I can easily
remove it when I get the kernel update mentioned above:

The German Mac Keyboard on the 2009 17" Macbook Pro seems to have two keys
mixed up.

This doesn't happen on my extended UK Mac ISO external keyboard. It doesn't
happen on a PC German keyboard.  And it doesn't happen on my 2013 11" Macbook
Air.  I don't know if this is something that happens on older Macbooks, older
ISO Keyboards, German Mac Keyboards... but if you are reading this, maybe you
are only here because you have the same problem, and found this in a web
search.

If 

<image src="../images/mixed-up.jpeg" alt="German Mac Keyboard with keys 94 and 49 circled" height="200" />

If you have the same problem as me, the two circled keys, the one in the top
left corner, and the one next to the shift key, are reversed.  Keycodes 94 and
49 are mixed up! You choose the correct Mac keyboard configuration, but then
when you press one of those guys, you get the symbols on the other!

If you have this problem, you can read all my notes on it
[here](../tl-dr.md#key-mix-up) if you really want to, or just try out this fix:

To fix this, I creating a new MAC keyboard variant for keyboards with this issue
by subclassing the normal mac keyboard layout:

<sub>
  This example is for German, but I'll explain a bit more about other keyboards
</sub>

```
# cat >> /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/de
partial alphanumeric_keys
xkb_symbols "mac_fixed" {

    include "de(mac)"

    name[Group1]= "German (Macintosh, fixed)";

    key <TLDE>  { [ less, greater, bar, dead_belowmacron ] };
    key <LSGT>  { [ dead_circumflex, degree, U2032, U2033 ] };
};
```

and then add this to `/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.xml`

```
<variant>
  <configItem>
    <name>mac_fixed</name>
    <description>German (Macintosh, Fixed)</description>
  </configItem>
</variant>
```


right underneath the variant you subclassed.

I put an `F` in one of the names and `f` in the other so that I can figure
out which of the two labels actually matters. So far the one in `evdev.xml`
seems to be the one that matters.

If your keyboard is not German, and say you have this problem with a UK keyboard
then just look through `/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/gb`.  Start with the
definition of the `mac` variant, and follow the includes up the chain until
you find the defintions that it is using for `LSGT` and `TLDE`. Then copy them
into your new variant, and swap the keys!

This keyboard setting should be in your setting menus next time you restart.

You can also set it immediately like this:
```
$ setxkbmap -layout de -variant mac_fixed
```

except it will bypass the settings menu, and your keyboard layouts options
will still be set to whatever they were set to before. And if you change and
save the settings menu, you will still not have this option.  There is probably
a way to clear the cache without logging out but I don't know it.

You can still use `setxkbmap` to test out your keyboard, and then get
your full menu back the next restart.

Once you add the above and restart, you should see this in your keyboard
layout options:

<image alt="Keyboard settings with keys reversed" src="../images/fixed.png" height="300" />

... a layout that looks backwards in the picture, but actually works correctly
because your keyboard is also backwards.
